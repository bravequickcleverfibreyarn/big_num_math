Supereasy
    - consider num ctors for other numbers
    - consider shortcuts: 0 * anything = 0, 1 * anything = anything, 0 ± anything = anything, anything / 1 = anything, 0^n=0 n∊ℕ﹥₀, 1^n = 1 n∊ℕ₀

Easy
    - inspect mulmul without intermediate product: to be better only stack must employed (no Vec writes) => addition method split
    - make pow log effecient
    - mulmul escape for 0 multiplier
    - check once again whether division is "im"possible (avoid substracting)

Medium
    - array of usizes: reduces memory footprint twice (1001=9, 1001 1001 = 9 9)

Questionable
    - reflect to lite, especially to mishmas proj
